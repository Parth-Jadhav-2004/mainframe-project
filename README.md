## üìñ About the Project

We've built an AI-powered COBOL-to-pseudocode converter that helps modern developers understand legacy mainframe code. The tool automatically analyzes COBOL programs and generates three key outputs: (1) clean, structured pseudocode with modern syntax, (2) plain-English explanations of the code's logic, and (3) visual flowcharts showing the program's control flow. This bridges the knowledge gap for developers unfamiliar with COBOL's verbose syntax.

Technical Implementation:
The system uses Python (Flask) for the backend, with Google's Gemini AI for code analysis and explanations, and Graphviz for flowchart generation. Users upload COBOL files (.cob or .txt) through a web interface, and the system processes them through three stages: parsing the COBOL structure, converting to pseudocode with AI, and generating visual diagrams. The responsive web UI shows results in separate tabs with copy/download options.

Key Benefits:
This tool dramatically reduces the time needed to understand legacy systems, helps onboard new developers to mainframe projects, and supports modernization efforts. Unlike manual analysis, it provides instant, consistent documentation with visual aids - especially valuable as COBOL expertise becomes scarce. The entire solution runs as a web app for easy access without local setup.
