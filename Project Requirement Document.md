# Project Requirements Document: COBOL to Pseudocode Converter with AI Explanation and Flowchart

| Requirement ID | Description                          | User Story                                                                 | Expected Behavior/Outcome                                                                 |

| FR001          | COBOL File Upload                   | As a user, I want to upload a COBOL file (.cob or .txt) to convert it.     | System accepts file uploads and validates the format before processing.                  |
| FR002          | COBOL Code Parsing                  | As a user, I want the system to parse COBOL syntax accurately.             | System tokenizes and analyzes COBOL divisions, variables, and logic into structured data.|
| FR003          | Pseudocode Generation               | As a user, I want the COBOL code converted to readable pseudocode.         | System generates structured pseudocode (e.g., `WHILE` loops, `IF-ELSE` conditions).      |
| FR004          | AI-Powered Explanation              | As a user, I want an AI to explain the COBOL logic in plain English.       | System uses Gemini API to generate human-readable explanations of the code.              |
| FR005          | Flowchart Generation                | As a user, I want a visual flowchart of the COBOL programâ€™s logic.         | System creates a flowchart (Graphviz/D3.js) showing control flow and logic structures.   |
| FR006          | Export Results                      | As a user, I want to export the outputs.                                   | System allows exporting pseudocode (TXT), explanations (PDF), and flowcharts (PNG/SVG).  |
| FR007          | Web-Based UI                        | As a user, I want a simple interface to upload files and view results.     | UI includes file upload, results display, and export buttons (Flask/React).              |
| FR008          | Error Handling                      | As a user, I want clear error messages for invalid COBOL syntax.           | System validates COBOL syntax and highlights errors (e.g., missing divisions).           |
